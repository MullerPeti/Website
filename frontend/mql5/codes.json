The strategy follows the following logic:First the strategy marks the high and the low of the first 4H candle, using the New york time zone.After the first 4H candle is formed the strategy waits for a 5 Minute candle to close outside the Range. If a 5 Minute candle closes above the High and then a 5 Minute candle closes back in the Range, there is a sell signal.If a 5 Minute candle closes below the Low and then a 5 Minute candle closes back in the Range, there is a buy signal.",
