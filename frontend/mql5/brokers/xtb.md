## Short summary

XTB is a multi-asset broker primarily known for its proprietary xStation platform, with a focus on regulated access to CFDs and longer-horizon retail trading rather than MetaTrader-based automation.

## Broker overview

XTB operates as a publicly listed brokerage group with a strong presence in Europe.  
Its offering is structured around a proprietary trading platform and a broad range of instruments, including indices, forex, commodities, equities, and ETFs (depending on jurisdiction).

The broker’s positioning emphasizes regulatory transparency, platform usability, and access to traditional and CFD markets rather than execution optimization for algorithmic trading.

## Trading platforms

- xStation (proprietary platform)  
- Web-based trading interface  
- Mobile trading application  

XTB does not focus on MetaTrader platforms.  
The xStation platform is designed primarily for discretionary trading, portfolio-style workflows, and longer-horizon strategies, with limited support for automated trading compared to MT4/MT5 environments.

## Regulation and legal structure

XTB operates under several European regulators:

- Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF)  
- Financial Conduct Authority (United Kingdom)  
- Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)  

EU clients are subject to ESMA regulations, including leverage limits and mandatory risk protections.  
US residents are not accepted.

## Costs and execution

Trading costs at XTB are typically **medium**:

- Spread-based pricing on most instruments  
- No separate commission on many CFD products  
- Costs are generally higher than ECN-style brokers but transparent  

Execution quality is stable for retail trading but not optimized for high-frequency or latency-sensitive strategies.

## Suitable use cases

XTB may be appropriate for:

- Swing trading and discretionary trading  
- Longer-term position trading and portfolio-style strategies  
- Trading indices, forex, and commodity CFDs  
- Traders prioritizing regulation and a proprietary platform experience  

It is generally less suitable for:

- Automated trading using MetaTrader  
- Scalping or cost-sensitive algorithmic strategies  
- Traders seeking raw-spread or ECN-style execution  

## User base and reputation

XTB reports a global user base in the range of **2M+ clients**.  
Public feedback often highlights platform usability and regulatory credibility, with mixed opinions on spreads and advanced trading features.

As with all brokers, trading conditions depend on jurisdiction, regulatory entity, and account configuration.
