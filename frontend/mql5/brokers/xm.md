## Broker overview

XM operates through several regulated entities, serving retail clients across Europe and many non-EU regions.  
The broker is widely known for its large client base, simplified onboarding process, and extensive educational and promotional ecosystem.

Its positioning is oriented toward mass retail participation rather than execution-optimized or institution-style trading.

## Trading platforms

- MetaTrader 5  
- Web-based trading interface  

MT4 and MT5 are supported with standard functionality, including expert advisors, indicators, and automated trading scripts.

## Regulation and legal structure

XM operates under the following regulators:

- Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC)  
- Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

EU clients are onboarded under the CySEC-regulated entity and are subject to ESMA leverage limits and investor protection rules.  
US residents are not accepted.

## Costs and execution

Trading costs at XM are typically **medium**:

- Mostly spread-based pricing models  
- Spreads are wider than ECN-focused brokers  
- Execution is reliable but not designed for cost-critical strategies  

Conditions may vary depending on account type and regulatory entity.

## Suitable use cases

It is generally less suitable for:

## User base and reputation

XM reports a global user base exceeding **15M+ registered clients**, making it one of the largest retail brokers by client count.  
Public feedback often reflects the broker’s accessibility and educational focus, with mixed opinions on spreads and execution conditions.

As with all brokers, trading conditions depend on jurisdiction, regulatory entity, and account configuration.
