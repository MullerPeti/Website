## Short summary

The broker is commonly used by discretionary traders and institutions requiring clear pricing models and strong legal protections.

## Trading platforms

- MetaTrader 4  
- TradingView  
- Web-based trading platform  

MT4 is supported with standard functionality, including expert advisors and custom indicators.

US and EU residents are accepted under their respective regulated entities.  
Leverage limits, margin requirements, and product availability vary significantly by jurisdiction.
