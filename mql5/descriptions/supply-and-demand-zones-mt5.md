## What It Does

The indicator analyzes historical price action and support/resistance structures to **dynamically build supply and demand zones**.  
Zones adapt as new data arrives, giving a realistic view of how market structure evolves.

It is designed for **price-action–based traders** who want objective zone detection without manual drawing.

## Key Features

- **Automatic supply & demand zone detection**
- Zones derived from **clustered support and resistance levels**
- Fully **customizable sensitivity and lookback**
- Clear **visual zones** (outline or filled rectangles)
- Optional **support & resistance arrows** for transparency
- **Distance-to-zone display** from current price
- **Alerts** when price approaches key zones
- Works on **any timeframe and symbol**

## How It Works

- When multiple **support levels** cluster together and price reacts upward → a **Demand Zone** is formed  
- When multiple **resistance levels** cluster together and price reacts downward → a **Supply Zone** is formed  
- Zones adjust dynamically as price forms new highs or lows

⚠️ This is a **repainting indicator**. Zones update as market structure evolves.
